# My_Kata_Solutions

Welcome! I'm Minakami Yuki, here are my codewars kata solutions!

Most of katas were solved by Haskell, in the meantime, there will be more and
more Coq or LEAN kata solutions as I'm learning these proof assistants.

I hope these solutions can help you have fun with CodeWars' interesting katas,
but don't copy my solutions to get points, which is definitely harmful to
yourself.
